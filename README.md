# Workout Tracker

## Main project goal

- The main goal of this application is to be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. The application will achieve this by logging multiple exercises in a workout on a given day (with the workout name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise). If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the application will track the distance traveled.

### Installation

## Instructions to run the application locally:

- Run..

```
npm install
```

- ..then run

```
npm start
```

## ..or view the hosted application live:

## Functionality

- The user may add exercises to a previous workout plan.
- The user may add exercises to a existing workout plan.
- The user may view the combined weight of multiple exercises on the stats page.

## Roadmap

- Create a user login with authentication
- There is a slight flash on dataload - will look into adding a spinner
