# Workout Tracker

## Main project goal

- The main goal of this application is to be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. The application will achieve this by logging multiple exercises in a workout on a given day (with the workout name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise). If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the application will track the distance traveled.

### Installation

- Run..

```

```

## Functionality

- There are 3 x burgers out of the box
- Users may add burgers they have devoured or have not yet devoured
- Users may choose to devour undevoured burgers, or yack out devoured burgers

## Roadmap

- Update the UI with a modern framework
- Add the ability to delete burgers
- Add the ability for users to log in and view their own data
